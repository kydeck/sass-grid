A small and simple CSS Grid framework meant to allow for flexible, responsive, and reusable grid layouts and column systems, written in SCSS and compiled to CSS via Dart Sass through the [sass NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)

### How to use
Simply download the minified release .css file or use the CSS files in the `/dist` directory in your project. You can see sample usage of the framework by viewing the **sample.html** file in '/sample'.
